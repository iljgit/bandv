                    I’ve had my plot on Burnside for about 15 years, starting as a complete allotment novice, and have been a member of the committee for much of that time. I am one of the two Burnside site managers, often spending too much time maintaining the site and not enough working my plot, but I do get enjoyment from both.

                    I started on the allotment in the Spring of 2009. Since then we have enjoyed abundant crops of bindweed and mare’s tail. As well as tending the plot I have the role of Burnside site manager along with Andy K. Over the years this has involved letting out plots to new tenants and generally working on the site as a whole.

                    I've had an allotment since 2005, I love to grow what I can't buy, so there's been some odd fruit and veg over the years. Converted to no-dig organic gardening about 7 years ago.

                    I've been steadfastly growing veggies wherever I could since I was a child - especially radishes, lettuce and potatoes - 
                    and I love nothing more than pottering around the plot, looking for jobs to do and just enjoying being outside.

                    I joined the Vinery Road site in 2015 shortly after moving to Cambridge, but I’ve had several allotments previously in various parts of the country where I have lived for work or study. I’m still getting to grips with our very dry East Anglian climate, free-draining loamy soil and the various resident pests and diseases! I guess I am an allotment traditionalist; 
                    I enjoy digging, 'ordinary' vegetables and growing in straight rows! Follow my horticultural exploits on Twitter @JasonDaff

                    I got a half plot for my partner's birthday in 2015 at Burnside, because we both love gardening and we got sick of starting from scratch every time we had to move house. Since then we've loved spending time outside on the plot, showing our two young kids how to grow different sorts of veggies. I joined the committee in 2017 to share my views on all the different topics with a key focus on the website.
