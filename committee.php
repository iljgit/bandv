                    I've had an allotment since 2005, I love to grow what I can't buy, so there's been some odd fruit and veg over the years. Converted to no-dig organic gardening about 7 years ago.

                    Moved to a bigger house but smaller garden (yard!) in 2007 and my wife got me a plot on the Vinery site. Chopped it out of the nettles, brambles and couch grass and have been there ever since growing stuff you can't buy in the shops or is much better fresh! I'm a relative newcomer to the committee but as Vice Chairman am happy to consider the accommodation  of all legal vices!

                    I started on the allotment in the Spring of 2009. Since then we have enjoyed abundant crops of bindweed and mare’s tail. As well as tending the plot I have the role of Burnside site manager along with Andy K. Over the years this has involved letting out plots to new tenants and generally working on the site as a whole.

                    I’ve had my plot on Burnside for about 12 years, starting as a complete allotment novice, and have been a member of the committee for much of that time. I am one of the two Burnside site managers, often spending too much time maintaining the site and not enough working my plot, but I do get enjoyment from both.

I make Vinery Allotment Updates for Mill Road TV with Glynn. These can be accessed via youtube: they offer great insights and are a great way of picking up tips and advice.

                    I got a half plot for my partner's birthday in 2015 at Burnside, because we both love gardening and we got sick of starting from scratch every time we had to move house. Since then we've loved spending time outside on the plot, showing our two young kids how to grow different sorts of veggies. I joined the committee in 2017 to share my views on all the different topics with a key focus on the website.
