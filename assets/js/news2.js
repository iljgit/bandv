                The week before the party was Flag Week on the Burnside site, celebrating diversity and individuality, with a friendly and communal spirit. There were plenty of country flags and some lovely home-made ones flying. You’ll find a photo gallery of the flags below.
                </p><p>
                Party preparations had been underway for several days but a dedicated group of volunteers completed additional jobs on the morning of the 15th before tenants, partners, family and friends began arriving at 1pm. These jobs included hanging out bunting, setting up tables and chairs, preparing the Tombola and the food and drinks tables, setting up the BBQs and building a children’s teepee. 
                </p><p>
                This year’s game, the “Oh So Simple Scavenger Hunt”, was prepared by Andy K. It was almost as fiendish as last year’s game, in spite of Andy’s protestations to the contrary, but most teams eventually solved the puzzles and the anagram by using the instruction sheets and wandering round the site to find Andy’s amazingly elaborate clues. That said, about half the teams fell into Andy’s equally elaborate and carefully planned trap and gave the incorrect answer! The winner, randomly selected from the correct answers, received an insulated picnic back-pack. 
                </p><p>
                Small prizes were also presented to Ingrid and Kate, joint winners of the online summer quiz on the website. Watch the website for another online quiz before too long!!
                </p><p>
                As always, the children were enthralled by Andy’s wind up gramophone, playing Glenn Miller, Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds, to name just a few. It was great to see that you don’t need today’s technology to entertain young and old.
                </p><p>
                A huge variety of food to share was brought along and devoured during the afternoon, including lots of lovely homemade salads to accompany the bbq, with tea, coffee and cake later on. The party went on until nearly 6pm, practically everything had been consumed, and all left saying what a lovely afternoon it had been. 
                </p><p>
                Many thanks to all the helpers, all who brought food to share, and all who donated prizes to the Tombola, funds from which help to pay towards the cost of the afternoon. A very special thank you to Andy K for his massive amount of work, not least in preparing the scavenger hunt. We look forward to seeing everyone at the next Burnside event: keep an eye on the website, emails and the notice boards.                
                </p>
                <p>A great day - and here are some pictures to help remember it.</p>`,

Plot-holders were not put-off by the strong breeze and while it was a struggle to keep the gazebos anchored to the ground it didn’t stop the Vinery community enjoying a BBQ and selection of creative salads, side dishes, pies, quiches, breads and desserts which showed off some of our fantastic produce. 
                </p><p>
                Guests were entertained by a coconut shy and giant Jenga borrowed from Jen and Nicks wedding, as well as a Tombola of useful gardening items. Vinery stalwart and former site manager Glynn Gorick was presented with a bottle to thank him for his excellent service to the site.
                </p><p>
                Special thanks to the party organising group (Neena, Katrina, Jen, Tom and Jason) for pulling everything together and making the afternoon so enjoyable.

<p>Volunteers arrived early and were allocated a variety of planned tasks. Weeding the hazels next to the Snakey Path fence, clearing the plot planned for future raised beds, clearing an area near the toilet and installing sunken bins for the storage of toilet waste, cutting back the Ancaster way hedge, and refurbishing recently acquired used garden furniture, to name just a few. At lunchtime we shared a well-earned and tasty BBQ, after which many people worked on for the rest of the day until gone 5 o’clock.</p>

Two large nuisance trees were felled and chopped up. All seven of the site’s water troughs were cleaned out and refilled. The community orchard was weeded, as were the hazels alongside Snakey path, and much of the main store building’s timber was treated. Other smaller areas on the site were cleared and or cut back.

It was a great success, with lots of Burnside and Vinery plot holders, together with friends and family, meeting up on a gloriously sunny September afternoon. They were able to use the new site toilet, albeit not fully completed but fully useable. A lot of work, by many, had been put into preparation for the day, which of course always helps to make things run smoothly.</p>" +

                <h2 class="text-center">Trevor Taylor, our Honorary President, passed away peacefully in Addenbrooke's Hospital on Wednesday 19th September 2018.</h2>

                <p>His burial will take place at the
                
                <b>Woodland Burial Ground, Barton on Tuesday, 9th October at 2.15pm.</b></p>
                
                <p>Trevor Taylor was our Honorary President, and The Vinery Road “Trevor Taylor Pavilion” is named in his honour. 
                In addition to 40 years’ service to Burnside &Vinery as secretary and treasurer, Trevor was also NSALG treasurer and East Anglia rep 
                for some years. He developed a brain tumour in 2010 but recovered sufficiently to carry on attending committee meetings until about 2012.</p>

                <p>Trevor instigated many of the things that we take for granted today, such as the Kings Seed orders and yearly BBQs, 
                and he was a key contributor to the campaign to maintain allotments in the 1980s, when their future was in doubt. 
                Trevor was a true character, with his love of Jazz, red wine and cricket, and his dry witty banter. RIP.<p>
                
                <p></p>
                
                <h3>Last year, Andy K and Joan met Trevor</h3>
                <p>On Friday 3rd February 2017 Andy K and Joan from the committee met up with Trevor Taylor, our Honorary President, 
                for a catch up at the Royal Standard on Mill Road. Trevor walked from his home (albeit with the aid of a walker), 
                took little persuasion to partake in a couple of glasses of red wine, enjoyed a fish lunch and regretted not bringing a cigar! 
                The conversation ranged widely. Non-allotment matters included Trevor’s ongoing love of jazz. 
                Allotment matters included the annual seed buying scheme with King’s, which Trevor set up, even though the committee of the 
                time were not in favour of the idea: it would be interesting to work out how much money the scheme has made for the 
                Society over the years and how much members have saved on the cost of seeds.</p><p>Although few, if any, will 
                remember that far back, most of the AGMs took place at the Royal Standard in the 1980s (as witness Trevor’s minutes, 
                painstakingly written out by hand for many years). 1990s AGMs were mostly held at The Grasshopper nearby, 
                although that no longer exists. We discovered that the Burnside site used to be referred to as the Perne Road site, 
                as it was of course very much bigger once upon a time. And it was largely Trevor’s hard fought negotiation with the Council 
                which prevented the Vinery Road site from losing much more land than it did to the building of St Philip’s School in 1984.</p>
                <p>We also talked about the ‘Weeder’s Digest’ that Trevor produced periodically – <i>if anyone still has copies of this it would be 
                great to see them</i>. The hints and tips section of our new website is now named ‘Weeder’s Digest’ 
                (in Trevor’s honour and with his permission!) and we will also use his cookery section title ‘From Plot to Pot’ 
                (again, with his permission) for recipes on the website.</p>`,
