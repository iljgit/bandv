                            <p>Our two allotment sites, Burnside and Vinery Road, are in the Romsey Town area of south Cambridge.</p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Our sites are actively managed and boast facilities including running water and toilets.  There is a store which provides 
                            discounted allotment goods from spring to early summer. The allotment holders are a genuinely friendly bunch (what else would you expect from garden enthusiasts?) and you can always find someone ready to offer advice or help.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The Society supports a variety of community causes through the provision of plots and facilities.
