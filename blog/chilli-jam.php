Summer 2018 finds me with an early glut of tomatoes, so I’ve put some of them to good use by making tomato and chilli jam, a nice accompaniment for cheese, meat, and fish. 
Or just slap it on your sarnies. The tomatoes I’ve used are Red Alert from Kings, which I sowed towards the end of January. 
Kings describe them as ‘a very early outdoor cropper: one of the very best for flavour. Masses of small fruits are produced on bushy plants with no need for side-shooting’. 
</p>
<p>
I would agree with most of this, although I think the flavour of Red Alert is less than stunning (even more reason to convert them into something with more of a kick). 
They are also relatively thick skinned: perhaps they would fare better in a greenhouse instead of the minimal outdoor protection provided by my slightly 
ramshackle upright cold frame. However, I have been harvesting them since the end of June, around 1lb a day from 10 plants, and the flavour does seem to be improving with time.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>                        
<li>1kg tomatoes</li>
<li>460g red peppers</li>
<li>70g chillies</li>
<li>300g redcurrants</li>
<li>12g fresh ginger</li>
<li>150ml red wine vinegar</li>
<li>2tsp caraway seeds</li>
<li>2sp paprika</li>
<li>600g sugar</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Notes on ingredients</h4>
I didn’t actually include the redcurrants, but it would make for an interesting variation. I used a very mild chilli but I still find the resulting jam relatively hot, 
so I might reduce the quantity another time. I have also seen recipes which include onion, garlic, cumin, coriander and fish sauce: 
I think I would be happy to experiment with any of these except the fish sauce!
</p>

<p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cook all the roughly chopped ingredients (except the sugar) until soft</li>
<li>Blend roughly then return to the heat and add the sugar</li>
<li>Boil for quite a long time to reduce the sauce to a thick paste / jam (it won’t set like a jam, of course, as it doesn’t contain pectin)</li>
<li>Pour into jars and seal</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Notes on method</h4>
As you will see, the method in the recipe I found isn’t particularly detailed! I simmered the ingredients initially for around half an hour. It then took me about an hour of gentle boiling to get it to a reasonable consistency.
