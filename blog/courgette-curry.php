                        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        <p>
                            Courgettes: 2 medium diced<br>
                            Tomato 1 medium chopped or half cooking apple diced<br>
                            1 chopped onion<br>
                            1 tsp chopped ginger and/or garlic<br>
                            ¼ tsp mustard seeds<br>
                            ¼ tsp turmeric powder<br>
                            ½ tsp red chilli powder<br>
                            1 tsp garam masala<br>
                            1 tbsp oil  <br>
                            Salt to taste<br>
                            Chopped coriander leaves: 1 tbsp<br><br>
                            Optional: 1 tbsp crushed peanuts/ dash of cream or tahini or coconut milk (anything that you prefer to add to the texture or taste)
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h2>Method</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Heat the oil in pan, add mustard seeds and wait till they crackle then quickly add chopped onion, ginger and garlic.</li>
                            <li>Add red chilli powder, turmeric powder and stir for couple of minutes on a medium low heat.</li>
                            <li>Add cut courgettes and apple/tomato plus garam masala and put the lid on and cook on a medium heat for six to eight minutes.</li>
                            <li>Towards the end of cooking you can add a handful of crushed peanuts if you like it nutty. If you like it creamy then add a dash of cream or coconut milk and leave it to simmer with the lid on for three to five minutes.</li>
                            <li>Garnish it with the chopped coriander leaves and it is ready to eat.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            At stage 3, you can also add a handful of peas or some other similar consistency veg from your plot. I avoid allotment spinach style greens as they need a shorter cooking time and tend to get bitter if added to the above recipe.
