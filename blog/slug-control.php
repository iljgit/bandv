                    The recent wet weather has brought out the slugs and snails, which are now well and truly on the march.

                    To protect my courgettes and squashes, I take two different approaches:

            </div>

            <div class="row">

                    I buy copper scourers from the hardware store on Mill Road, unravel them into loops so that one scourer can be cut into 4 or 5 collars,     
                    and tuck them around the base of the plants to protect them while the stalks are small. 
                </li> </ul>

                    Additionally, or on their own, I put ‘Slug Gone’ pellets around the plants: these are pellets of wool impregnated with fertiliser, 
                    so when they disintegrate into the soil they also improve it.
