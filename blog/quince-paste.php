For anyone unfamiliar with quince, it’s a hard fruit related to the pear. You can’t eat it raw, but it cooks up very nicely into a jelly or a paste 
(the latter is especially popular in Spain, where it is known as membrillo and often paired with their sheep’s milk cheese, Manchego). 
I like its aromatic smell and the beautiful orangey colour it takes on when cooked.

I don’t have a quince tree, but I first started making quince paste when I saw one of those nice ‘Please help yourself’ buckets outside 
someone’s house a couple of years ago. You can even eat some of the ornamental varieties – Chaenomeles Japonica - although they have 
two major drawbacks: 1) they have less flavour 2) they are a nightmare to peel, being much smaller! My quince paste seemed to go down 
well at the Burnside summer party in September 2018, so here’s the recipe.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>                        
<li>4lbs (1.8Kg) of quinces, peeled, cored and chopped</li>
<li>Sugar (I don’t think it much matters whether it’s granulated or caster, and the amount is worked out during cooking)</li>
<li>Vanilla – pod or essence (optional: I don’t usually bother with vanilla, I think the quince has enough flavour of its own).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Put the quince pieces in a large pan and add enough water to cover. Add a vanilla pod or a drop of essence if you like. 
Simmer for 30-40 minutes with a lid on, or until the quince is soft.</li>
<li>Drain the liquid and weigh the fruit: note the weight, this is the weight of sugar you need.</li>
<li>Blend the fruit till smooth.</li>
<li>Return to pan, add the sugar and cook over low heat till sugar dissolved.</li>
<li>Continue to cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the paste has thickened and has a deep orange colour – 
watch out: it gets very hot at this point and bubbles and splashes up!</li>
<li>Pour into a greased / lined 20cm x 20cm baking tray and smooth out.</li>
<li>Put in oven, preheated to 50<sup>o</sup>C (120<sup>o</sup>F), to speed up the setting process, for about an hour.</li>
<li>Slice into manageable portions.</li>
</ol>
